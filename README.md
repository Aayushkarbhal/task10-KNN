## Objective
To classify handwritten digits (0–9) using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm and find the best value of K

## Dataset
We used the Sklearn Digits dataset, which contains 8×8 pixel images of handwritten digits
The dataset is built-in and does not require downloading

## Steps Performed

Loaded the digits dataset
Visualized sample digit images
Split data into training and testing sets
Applied StandardScaler for feature scaling
Trained KNN model with different K values (3, 5, 7, 9)
Plotted Accuracy vs K to select best K
Generated confusion matrix
Displayed predicted labels for test images

## Result
The KNN model achieved high accuracy, and the best K value was selected based on performance

## Tools Used
Python
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib
Jupyter Notebook
